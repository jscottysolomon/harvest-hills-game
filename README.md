# harvest-hills-game
This is a simulation game where you can run your own farm and grow crops, rear animals, and manage your farm economy. The game runs on a cycle-based system, with each cycle consisting of a day and a night. You earn passive income every day by selling crops or animal products, and you can earn more by hiring farmers and investing in crop and animal affinities.
